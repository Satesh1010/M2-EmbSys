# Introduction
This project automates the water supply for agricultural lands. It contains a soil moisture sensor for sensing the moisture level of the soil, if the moisture  level is low it supplies water using a servo motor. With this project a water is saved without wastage and it does not require human monitoring.
## High Level Requirements
|  HLR_ID|Description  |Status|
|--|--|--|
| HLR_1 |The System is Automatically Monitored and Controls the Pump On and Off  |TO BE IMPLEMENTED|
|HLR_2|Consumes a Small Amount Little Energy & Do Perfect On-Going Operations|TO BE IMPLEMENTED|
## Low Level Requirement
| LLR_ID | Description |Status|
|--|--|--|
| LLR_1 |  Can't loaded More Than the System Specifications|IMPLEMENTED|
|LLR_2|The System Can Operated in Night also which Results in Minimum Amount of the Water|TO BE IMPLEMENTED|
|LLR_3|Irrigation Process Starts and Stops When Needed Hence it Optimize Energy Requirements|TO BE IMPLEMENTED|
